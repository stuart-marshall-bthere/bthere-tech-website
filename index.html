          <h2>bThere Sense</h2>
          <p class="lead">The bThere Sense lets you know that your older loved ones are active and keeping to their habits. 
            The bThere Sense is a small, innovative device that sits under the senior's TV. 
            It sees the senior show up in the morning, go about their day, and when they head off to bed. 
            It sends this information to cloud services for smart analytics. 
            </p><p class="lead">
            The bThere service sends notifications to you if 
            it detects unusual and worrisome patterns, like Mom being two hours overdue in the morning.
            You can also check in and see that all is well.
            </p><p class="lead">
            The senior doesn't have to do or learn anything. It's all automatic. Setting it up is easy: plug in the device and putting it on the wifi.
            </p><p class="lead">
            Your senior's data is kept secure and private.
            You can purchase the device alone and get activity notifications for free. Or you can sign up for a photo subscription
            to see photos from your loved one's living room.
            </p><p class="lead">
              When you need to hire somebody to help out, we can help with that too.
